# MongoDB $inc Operator Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB. The error arises from attempting to increment a field with a string value instead of a numerical value.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet incorrectly uses the `$inc` operator to increment a field containing a string.  This leads to unexpected behavior, including potential data corruption or incorrect results.  The `$inc` operator is specifically designed to increment numeric values. 

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the field being incremented is of a numeric type (e.g., NumberInt, NumberLong).  If it needs to be created, it should be created as a number; if the value already exists, it needs to be converted to a number. 

## How to reproduce
1. Setup a MongoDB instance
2. Create a collection named `myCollection`
3. Insert a document with an existing or non-existing field `count`
4. Attempt to execute the query in `bug.js`
5. Observe unexpected behavior (if the field `count` is not a number type)

## How to solve
1. Check existing data types
2. Modify the query in `bugSolution.js` to ensure correct data types are used.
